  <p>
  I'm a data scientist based out of Provo, Utah.
  I am a recent graduate of Brigham Young University with a degree in statistics looking to pursue a master's degree in statistics in the fall of 2025. 
  I am passionate about leveraging data and using machine learning and AI methods to drive informed decisions in business and sports. 
  I am always open to connecting with fellow students, professors, data professionals, and anyone who shares a passion for data science! </p>

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my software engineering skills, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.
