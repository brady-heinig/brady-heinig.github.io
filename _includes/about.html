  <p>
  I'm a data scientist based out of Provo, Utah with a BS in Statistics from Brigham Young University. Currently, I am planning to pursue a MS in Statistics/Data Science in the Fall of 2025 and I am seeking DS internship opportunities in the meantime. 
  I am passionate about leveraging data and using machine learning and AI methods to drive informed decisions in sports, biotech, and banking. 
  I am always open to connecting with fellow students, professors, data professionals, and anyone who shares a passion for data science! </p>

      In a wide range of subject areas, I have analyzed structured and unstructured data to extract actionable business insights.
      I love to craft stunning and clever visualizations that illustrate surprising results.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my software engineering skills, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.

      I enjoy public speaking, writing professional articles, sharing my knowledge and discussing diverse topics.
      Thanks to my training and experience in science communication, I'm able to present complex results to a non-technical audience.
